### THE CHALLENGE :
```
The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it!
Connect to the program with netcat:

$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 53641

The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded here(https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/540/program-redacted.c)
```
We are given a C source code and a server to connect to.

First, let's analyze the C code.

```c
static void data_read() {
  char entry[4];
  long entry_number;
  char output[100];
  int r;

  memset(output, '\0', 100);
  
  printf("Please enter the entry number of your data:\n");
  r = tgetinput(entry, 4);
  // Timeout on user input
  if(r == -3)
  {
    printf("Goodbye!\n");
    exit(0);
  }
  
  if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
    puts(flag);
    fseek(stdin, 0, SEEK_END);
    exit(0);
  }

  entry_number--;
  strncpy(output, data[entry_number], input_lengths[entry_number]);
  puts(output);
}
```

Upon analyzing the C code, it looks like the data_read() function will give the flag if we bypass this check
```c
if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
  puts(flag);
  fseek(stdin, 0, SEEK_END);
  exit(0);
}
```

The **strtol** function skips all white-space characters at the beginning of the string, converts the subsequent characters as part of the number, and then stops when it encounters the first character that isn't a number.

Example:
When ```1234 Hello``` is given as an input to strtol it returns, 1234

What will happen if ```Hello``` is given as input? 

It will return a 0, which will bypass the check.
